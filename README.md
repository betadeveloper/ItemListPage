# Item List Page 
 To run it, open it in VS Code and run index.html on live server. It is using an API to retrieve database data to put into the table by using HTTP GET to the database on the list page. Form page creates a request and the form sends an HTTP POST request to put data into database, which is later retrieved into the table on the list page.

For testing purposes, the table does not have full CRUD integration. It only has create function for user. I am able to create, read, update, and delete through the database and it is possible to implement it to the end-user also.
